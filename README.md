# Features of FlavorFolio
* **Display Recipes**: At the interface top, we show real-time counts of recipes and ingredients. Below, recipes have 'Show,' 'Edit,' and 'Delete' options. 'Show' provides detailed info, 'Edit' allows customization, and 'Delete' removes a recipe from the collection.

</p>

* **Add Recipe**: The interface has four fields for 'Title,' 'Introduction,' 'Ingredients,' and 'Directions,' enabling structured recipe entry. Three buttons enhance this: 'Add Image' for visual appeal, 'Clear' for instant content removal, and 'Create' to save the recipe in the user's collection.

# About Us
In my second year of computer science engineering program at ENSA Marrakech, I collaborated with my groupmates—Bouataoui Mohamed Taha, Hsisou Dina, Benraho Samira, Loubna El Karroumi, and El Mellaqui Abderrahim—to develop this application. It was a rewarding experience as we combined our efforts, each bringing unique skills to the table.
