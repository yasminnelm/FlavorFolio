Ingredients
400g--spaghetti
1tbsp--olive oil
200g--sliced Primo Gourmet Selection Pancetta
2--garlic cloves
3-- Eggs
100ml--thickened cream
2/3 cup (50g)--freshly grated parmesan
2 tbsp-- parsley leaves

Directions
Cook pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions. Meanwhile, heat oil in a 
frypan over medium heat. Cook pancetta (200g sliced Primo Gourmet Selection Pancetta, cut into 1cm-wide strips), 
stirring, for 2-3 minutes until beginning to crisp. Add garlic for 30 seconds, then set pan aside.
Place eggs, yolk, cream and parmesan in a bowl. Season, then mix gently with a fork. Drain pasta, then return to pan. 
Quickly add egg and pancetta mixtures and parsley. Toss to combine - the heat from the pasta will cook the egg 
slightly and form a creamy sauce. Serve immediately with extra parmesan.
